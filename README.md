# Lorien-Legacies

## Description
Lorien Legacies is a high-quality in-depth mod that seeks so recreate Lorien Legacies in Minecraft! It adds legacies such as Regeneras and Lumen, as well as telekinesis and a host of other awesome abilities. A skill tree/progression system is currently planned too. Currently, the mod does not support multiplayer (but it's certainly a planned feature!)

## Prerequisites and setting up a workspace
To contribute to the mod you'll need [a working environment of Forge for Minecraft version 1.12.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmWBP5ifDlw) (any version of Forge should work, and the mod will most likely be compatible with different sub-versions of 1.12, but don't quote me on that). Once that's set up simply replace *src/main/resources* and *src/main/java* with the folders supplied in this GitHub repo (in the root directory). Run the project and if all goes well you should now have your workspace set up ready for working on Lorien Legacies! If you have any issues at all with setting things up please don't hesitate to ask for help (maybe start an issue on the repo or something).

## Contributing
Working on this mod takes time and effort, and as such our progress is limited. We'd welcome any contribution, no matter how big or small. Feel free to work on anything that interests you!

If you're able to program, things you could do include:
* Adding a new legacy (as long as it is balanced and lore friendly - if in doubt add it as an issue in the Issues tab under the label *question*)
* Tweaking an existing legacy
* Working on a new feature such as multiplayer support
* Checking the Issues section for bugs, enhancements, and other requests
* Finding bugs

Alternatively, if you're great at making assets such as textures and sound effects, you could make new ones that are needed, or replace old ones with better, higher quality ones (if the need presents itself). 

**We would also be very grateful to anyone who is willing to host a server for testing multiplayer, and/or play-testing the mod in order to find things like bugs and provide valuable insight**.

Since the code base is getting rather large at this point, you will most certainly want to become accustomed to the structure and order of the code. You can read about what different parts of the code do on our repo's [wiki](https://github.com/TheUltimateKerbonaut/Lorien-Legacies/wiki).
